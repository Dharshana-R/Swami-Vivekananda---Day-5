            <ul>
                <li>“The greatest religion is to be true to your own nature. Have faith in yourselves.”</li>
                <li>
                    “Strength is Life, Weakness is Death.
                    <br>
                    Expansion is Life, Contraction is Death.
                    <br>
                    Love is Life, Hatred is Death.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Talk to yourself once in a day, otherwise you may miss meeting an intelligent person in this
                    world."</li>
                <li>
                    "Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true."</li>
                <li>
                    “The great secret of true success, of true happiness, is this: the man or woman who asks for no
                    return, the perfectly unselfish person, is the most successful.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “In a day, when you don't come across any problems - you can be sure that you are travelling in a
                    wrong path”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “In a conflict between the heart and the brain, follow your heart. ”</li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    Indian independence activist Subhas Chandra Bose considered Vivekananda as his spiritual
                    teacher.<br> He called Vivekananda a "full-blooded masculine personality – and a fighter to the core
                    of being". <br>Bose told, under the "sacred influence" of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda his own life
                    got awakened.
